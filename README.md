This is an app to help people who live in apartment and share houses to help alleviate some of the awkwardness, and help cut down on the passive-aggressive post it notes. Essentially each housemate joins a household (By a code provided or household name.). From there you can track your daily, weekly, monthly tasks and mark off when you do them. You can also keep track of your shared household expenses. There will be a shopping list component as well so you can let eachother what things you need i.e. lightbulbs, dishsoap....

MVP would be all the features mentioned above. I think they'd all be essenial to make this app something useful. 

Post MVP I'd like to see if there's a way to link in Venmo or something to make paying eachother from the app simple. Also a messaging component so housemates dont have to deal with annoying group texts. Also maybe some kind of rewards system to reward housemates for doing tasks on time. Deploying to App Store

This addresses the problems people have when living in apartments with strangers or friends. It's a way to keep everyone organized. You'll know what you need to do to contribute. Also, having a communal shopping list is great so you never have to text a housemate again while they're out reminding them to pick up sponges.
